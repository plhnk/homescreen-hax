Inspired by [this post](https://david-smith.org/blog/2014/10/15/blank-icon-slots/).

*There are two (well...probably more but yeah) ways to do this. I used [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/), but you could just as easily use your own website...but I'm using Pages because not everyone has their own website. And Pages is pretty well documented so anybody should be able to do it!* 	

Fairly Straightforwardâ€“if you didn't read David Smith's blog post, what we're basically doing is making homescreen icons that math seamlessly blend into your wallpaper, creating the _illusion_ (trick) that your apps, etc are placed in different spots than the default grid. 

This is desirable for [at least] two reasons: 
1. Less stretching for your thumb
2. More attractive home screens


##How To:
1. [Fork this repo](https://github.com/plhnk/homescreen-hax/#fork-destination-box) 
2. Download the [Sketch template](../assets/template.sketch) and add your wallpaper as indicated in the layer labels
2. Export the wallpaper and homescreen icons (@1x and @3x)
3. Add the thumbnails to the [tiles](../docs/tiles/) folder
4. [Configure GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/) for this repo 
5. Based on your desired homescreen configuration, set up the appropriate html files
6. Set the wallpaper you exported in step 2 on your phone
7. On your phone, navigate to the pages you set up in step 5 and save them to the homescreen, be sure to *not* type anything into the description field
8. Deposit money in da bank :dollar::dollar::dollar:
